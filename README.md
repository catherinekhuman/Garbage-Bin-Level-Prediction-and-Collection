Garbage Bin Level Prediction and Collection

Khumanthem Catherine


1. AIM OF THE PROJECT

   The aim of this project is to predict the fill level of garbage bins using machine learning algorithms to optimize waste collection processes.
   

3. UNIQUENESS/DIFFERENTIATOR TRIED OUT IN THE PROJECT

   The project employs advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze sensor data from garbage bins, allowing real-time predictions of when bins will need to be emptied.


3. INFERENCE

   The model predicts the filled status of garbage bins using binary classification (True/False). Thus, waste collection services can be preemptively optimized before bins overflow.


4. METRICS OF THE PROJECT

   The project evaluates the performance of various machine learning models using the following metrics:
   Accuracy
   Precision
   Recall
   F1-Score
